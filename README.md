# GET-POST-Methods

This project demonstrates the use of PHP with both GET and POST methods in a simple HTML form.

## Description

The project includes a basic HTML form that allows users to enter their name and select the HTTP method (GET or POST). The form dynamically updates its action and method attributes based on the selected method.

## Usage

To run this PHP project locally, you can use a local server environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/GET-POST-Methods.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd GET-POST-Methods
    ```

3. **Start a local server**. You can use PHP's built-in server for this:

    ```bash
    php -S localhost:8000
    ```

    This command starts a local server on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

4. **Access the project in your web browser**:

    Open your preferred web browser and go to [http://localhost:8000/index.php](http://localhost:8000/index.php).

5. **Use the form**:

    - Enter your name.
    - Select the desired method (GET or POST).
    - Click the "Submit" button to see the form in action.

6. **Stop the local server**:

    When you're done testing the project, stop the local server by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running.

Feel free to adjust the instructions based on your project structure or any specific requirements. This assumes you have PHP installed on your local machine. If not, you'll need to install PHP first.
